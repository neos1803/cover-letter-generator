        <p>Dear SIRCLO</p>
        <p>
          I'm Nanda Wardi Purba and currently work as a back end developer at
          Indonesia Open University. I'm very interested in becoming a part of
          SIRCLO as a back end software engineer and I'm so challenged and eager
          to land my new IT career in new place and atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my work, I used to participate in several projects and work
          with several tech stacks and mentor some of the seniors about the new
          tech stacks we proposed. Most of the projects consisted of same tech
          stacks like PostgreSQL, NestJS, GraphQL and Redis, but one projects
          used Express Typescript as the framework. Before using the mentioned
          tech stacks, our unit used to develop apps using oldversion laravel as
          their framework. Me and my team proposed to use new tech stacks, since
          they arenâ€™t keeping up with new technology. Our tech stacks proposal
          got approved and we were assigned to teach and mentor the other
          seniors about the new technology, eventhough we were supposed to be
          junior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those experiences allow me to keep up my skill with new technology as
          well as developing my confidence by mentoring others which I think are
          needed in an IT career, especially back end development. I have
          attached my resume for you to review. Thank you for your time. It
          would be great to be interviewed by you and I look forward to hearing
          from you soon.
